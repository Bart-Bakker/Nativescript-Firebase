# Nativescript-Firebase

This app is built with the NativeScript CLI. Once you have the CLI installed, start by cloning this repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/Bart-Bakker/Nativescript-Firebase.git
$ cd nativescript-plugin-firebase
$ cd Firebase

Next, install the app's iOS and Android runtimes, as well as the app's npm dependencies:

$ tns install
Now you can use the run command to run the demo app on iOS:

$ tns run ios --emulator
$ tns emulate ios --device iPhone-6s

.. or on Android
$ tns run android --emulator
$ tns emulate android --geny "Nexus 6_23"
